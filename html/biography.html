                    Carrie Crane’s artistic practice fuses science and art to address issues of truth and ambiguity.  Her work includes sculptural constructions, sketches, and paintings, all of which imply maps, diagrams, and scientific instruments.  Her current series, Beyond Measure, links ambiguous instruments and two-dimensional works .  These sculptural “instruments of measure” assess un-quantifiable ideas  emerging from emotional responses and forgotten memories.  The data suggested by the instrument’s suggested analysis is incorporated in their accompanying acrylic and mixed media diagrams and maps.
