                Carrie Crane’s artistic practice fuses science and art to address issues of truth
                and ambiguity.  Her work includes sculptural constructions, sketches, and 
                paintings, all of which imply maps, diagrams, and scientific instruments. Her 
                current series, Beyond Measure, links ambiguous instruments and two-dimensional 
                works. These sculptural &ldquo;instruments of measure&rdquo; assess un-quantifiable ideas  
                emerging from emotional responses and forgotten memories.  The data suggested by 
                the instrument’s suggested analysis is incorporated in their accompanying acrylic 
                and mixed media diagrams and maps.
